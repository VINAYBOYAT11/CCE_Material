1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:03,570
In this video, we will practically see inheritance.

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:10,560
I have to give an example of Circle and Selander, so already I have a class full circle here which

3
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:14,700
is having a property radius and three met her father ADR.

4
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:19,170
Then perimeter and circumference.

5
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:24,790
I have not read anything constructor in this class, but I mean, the property is public so that we

6
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:25,990
can directly access it.

7
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:29,650
We will be discussing about the constructor's in the next menials.

8
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:31,260
So the total goes to.

9
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:35,510
Tell me, have a class called certain knowledge does achieve inheritance.

10
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:36,480
No.

11
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:38,350
Let us see an example of inheritance.

12
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:43,420
I a like class four cylinder that extends.

13
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:45,390
Circle.

14
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:52,840
So this class will get all the features of our circle class means that the property and all these materials

15
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:56,170
are available inside the cylinder class also.

16
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:59,920
And because all of them are public, they are also accessible.

17
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:03,470
All cylinders should also have its own properties.

18
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,110
So I will declare properties.

19
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:09,600
So the property's height, so to make a death double.

20
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:15,830
There's only one method I will vote on that is from volume to calculate volume.

21
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,590
So whole volume is calculated.

22
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:23,240
It will return area multiplied by pite.

23
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:31,680
See, I'm able to call this maturity Yamit hard because this area mutatis present an inside cylinder

24
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,000
glass also because it is boring it from circle class.

25
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:41,670
So this idea multiplied by height does is sufficient to look at the demonstration?

26
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:48,390
No, I will create the object of cylinder glass and I will call volume method and I will show you inside

27
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:57,810
mean matured create an object of cylinder glass, see a sign new cylinder is created.

28
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,760
Now I should initialize the properties.

29
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:06,750
So Cylinder's Radiuses seven and Cylinder's hiatus.

30
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:16,790
Then next, I will display volume of a cylinder she got will you let us run it?

31
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:20,740
Yes, I got the volume here.

32
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:22,540
That is fifteen.

33
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:24,140
Thirty nine is the volume.

34
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,910
I will call Eddie, I'm a third also.

35
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:31,690
So here I will give a label that is volume.

36
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:39,930
Then after this, I will call Ethereum a Tuttle's printing C dot India.

37
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,260
Let us run it.

38
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:46,440
Yes, I got volume as well as area of cylinder.

39
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:54,130
I will enter and debug more and show you how this is working, because this area matters present inside

40
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:56,740
circle class legacy, what is really happening?

41
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:03,900
I'll put a break point here, then I will enter and go debug mode, press seven.

42
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:05,530
Then again at seven.

43
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,380
Now you can see the value of radius radiuses seven.

44
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:09,780
And the value of high distance.

45
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:17,440
If I go up into the glasses and highlight this radius, it's not showing anything because this code

46
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:18,850
is not yet active now.

47
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:27,380
And Cylinder Morwood is also not showing anything can let us enter into this Cedartown volume matter.

48
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:33,100
So if I press S7, it will enter into print and so I should press shift F seven.

49
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,420
So it will enter into volume Atun.

50
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,950
Yes, it is calling volume a total four cylinder class.

51
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:45,610
And if I put a cursor on heighted assuring 10 and garcelon radius it is showing seven, she one of the

52
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:47,900
matter of this class is being used now.

53
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:50,610
So it is showing this properties with some values.

54
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,330
So while you morsal in this car.

55
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,590
So let us move next.

56
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:56,650
I'm on this line.

57
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,580
That's S7.

58
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:04,560
No, you can see that area Methode of the circle is called because from this volume, Matari was calling.

59
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,030
Edith thought of finding the area, then multiplied by height F seven.

60
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:10,680
Now back to William.

61
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:16,650
Back to main method next, I will enter into a.D.A method.

62
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:21,810
So shift F seven, who it is calling area method of a circle.

63
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:24,890
Yes, because that is the only area method we have.

64
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:25,490
See.

65
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:31,730
I am calling it turn up on a cylinder because I have a reference of cylinder, an object of cylinder.

66
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:38,720
So when I see a seat or area than the area of a circle matre this car so that this, we can understand

67
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,140
that this, the cylinder class is boring the features of a circle class.

68
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:46,040
It is boring all the properties and methods.

69
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:47,730
So that's all in this video.

70
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:51,380
I have given Valon the example for a circle and Selander then.

71
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:55,360
Now rest of the examples I will give them as a student exercises.

72
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:58,330
So following me, those will be on in exercises.

73
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:00,480
So you complete ludic situs.

74
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:01,480
That's a.
